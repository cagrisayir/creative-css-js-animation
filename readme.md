# CSS & JS Animations

In this Github Repository, I will share my learning journey about CSS and Javascript Animation properties. I can share simple codes or videos or images of animations.

### 1. basics

- `transition-property: background-color` -- properties for transition (necessary)
  - `translate()` for changing the location of the divs
- `transition-duration: 1s` -- duration time (necessary)
- `transition-timing-function` -- how the change in the property will occur.
    - **ease**: the change starts slow then go faster then finishes slow
    - **linear**: the change occurs at the same rate
    - **ease-in**: the change starts slow then go faster before the end
    - **ease-out**: the change starts fast then slows down before the end
    - **ease-in-out**: the change starts slow then go faster then finishes slow
- **Transition-Delay**: Time before the transition starts.
